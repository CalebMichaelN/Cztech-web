        <p>We are living in a world that is evolving and changing every and each day.
            New technology is emerging, for developing people's lives on new car technology to new medical solution problems
            for helping the blind and for better medical advancement.
        </p>
        <p>We need to change on how we live to enable people to live in a better way</p>
        <p>On this page I will be talking about Robots, new car technology for the 
            future and neuralink technology</p>
<ol>
    <li><u><strong>NEURALINK</strong></u></li>
    <img src="./Images/neurotechnology-artificial-intelligence-technology-2D7M3WA.jpg" width="1236" height="636"/>
    <p>~This is an ultra high bandwidth brain-machine interfaces to connect humans and computers
        This is technology developed by <a href="https://www.britannica.com">Elon Musk</a>who is a Techprenuer 
        changing the life of the Tech world.
    </p>
   <p> ~These neuralink devices uses cases ranging from treating Parkson's disease and restoring bodily function
    in paralyzed patients,to control computers with thoughts and communicating telepathically with other users.
This tech giant was founded in <em>2016</em> and is still under development
   </p>
<li><u><strong>ROBOTS</strong></u></li>
<p>~~The human world is changing and the world is being developed by technology for various things.</p>
<p>~~A robot is a machine- especially one programmable by a computer</p>
<p>##The following are robots that have been built with the improvement of AI(Artificial Intelligence);</p>
<ul>
    <li>SOPHIA;</li>
    <p>This is a social humanoid robot developed by the Hong Kong-based 
        company Hnason Robotics.It was developed in February 14,2016,and made her first public appearance in Mid 
        March 2016 and hence has gained alot of attention in the world as it can speak.
    </p>

    <li>AMECA;</li>
    <p>This is the world's most advanced human shaped robot representing the fore-front of human -robotics neurotechnology-artificial-intelligence-technology
        designed as a platform of AI development.
